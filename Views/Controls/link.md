link is a view that creates a navigation link to a URL that you provide. It allows you to open web URLs or deep links into other apps from your SwiftUI app. When a user taps on a Link, the system opens the URL in the appropriate app. For web URLs, this typically means opening the URL in the default web browser.



```xml
<body>
    <link url="https://shaffex.github.io">Open URL</link>
</body>
```
