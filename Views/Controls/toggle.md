In SwiftUI, a Toggle is a control that allows users to toggle between a true or false state. It is visually represented as a switch that users can tap or swipe to change its state. The Toggle view takes a binding to a Boolean value, which it updates according to the user's interaction. It also requires a label, which is typically used to describe the purpose of the toggle.

*My Toggle*

```xml
<body>
  <form>
    <toggle key="myToggle" value="true">My Toggle2</toggle>
    <toggle key="myToggle2" value="false">My Toggle2</toggle>
   </form>
</body>
```
