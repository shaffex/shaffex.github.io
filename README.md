## Customised and Blazing Fast XML Parser
Our XML parser is a high-performance, customised solution designed to handle a wide range of XML documents. It's engineered to be blazing fast, making it ideal for applications that require real-time processing of large XML files.

## Features

### Support for Comments

Our parser fully supports XML comments. This means you can include notes in your XML documents without affecting the data that the parser extracts.

### CDATA Support

The parser also supports CDATA sections, allowing you to include text that the parser will not interpret as XML markup. This is useful for including content such as scripts or HTML markup in your XML documents.

### Ordered Attributes

Unlike many XML parsers, our solution maintains the order of attributes in XML elements. This can be crucial for applications where the order of attributes matters like in SwiftUI views.
